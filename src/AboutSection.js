        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
          I'm <strong>Ibrahim Syed</strong>, previously a <strong>Front-End Team Lead</strong> at Resilience Inc., 
          where I led the front-end development of a dynamic learning platform using React. 
          As I complete my <strong>B.S. in Computer Science</strong> at Georgia State University, 
          I’ve gained hands-on experience in both web and mobile app development, specializing in technologies 
          like <strong>React</strong>, <strong>React Native</strong>, and <strong>Kotlin</strong>.
        </p>
        <p>
          My technical expertise is centered around <strong>front-end development</strong> with a deep focus on <strong>React</strong>, 
          building responsive and dynamic web applications. I also specialize in <strong>Android development</strong> 
          using <strong>Kotlin</strong>, creating efficient and scalable mobile applications. 
          I work extensively with <strong>GitHub</strong> for version control and thrive in <strong>Agile</strong> environments, 
          collaborating closely with teams to deliver high-quality, user-centric designs.
        </p>
        <p>
          Whether it's creating seamless user experiences or leading teams to execute aesthetic and functional designs, 
          I’m always striving to enhance the efficiency and visual appeal of the projects I work on. 
          I’m passionate about leveraging technology to solve real-world problems, with a particular focus on scalable and intuitive solutions.
